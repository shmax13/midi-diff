# midi-diff
A python tool for midi diff visualization using mido, numpy, and matplotlib.  
The script is a prototype, created as part of my bachelor's thesis in late 2022.

## Usage
Install *numpy*, *matplotlib* and *mido* before using the tool.  
Some demo files are stored in the *demo_files* folder.  
The two files that should be compared can be chosen by modifying the *main* function.  
The program will ask you which of the 16 MIDI music channels you want to compare.  
The image above is the result of comparing MIDI channel 0 of the files uc2_old.mid and uc2_new.mid.
